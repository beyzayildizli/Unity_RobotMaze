# Unity_RobotMaze
Welcome to Unity_RobotMaze, my second project using Unity and my first game created in Unity! 

## Game Description
In this game, the objective is to guide the robot to complete the maze in the shortest possible path.

### Gameplay
Navigate the maze by shooting at the red walls. At the beginning of the game, the player starts with 100 points. Every time a player shoots at a wall in the wrong direction, they lose 10 points. The game ends when the player successfully completes the maze.

### Controls
- Move Forward: W / Up Arrow
- Move Backward: S / Down Arrow
- Turn Left: A / Left Arrow
- Turn Right: D / Right Arrow
- Toggle Flashlight: F
- Change Camera View: C
- Shoot: Right Mouse Button

## Music
The game features two different tracks of music. Players can change the in-game music and adjust the volume settings from the menu.

## Planned Features
I have several features I'd like to implement in the future to enhance the game:

- Customizable Controls: Players will be able to customize controls to their preferences.
- Preventing Falls: Implement mechanisms to prevent the robot from falling when attempting to pass through walls.
- Maze Overview: Display a snapshot of the maze's layout for 3 seconds at the start of the game.

I'm excited to continue developing and enhancing the game with these and other improvements.
